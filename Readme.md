# NPC Generator

A python app used to generate a random NPC for TTRPG games. Although it was made with D&D 5e in mind, it is vague enough to be used for other games. 

Data is stored in a python file.
NPC can be saved and loaded from the app (JSON format)

You can reroll each stat individually, or all at once. There is save function.

# Before Running:

You must have Tkinter installed. In your terminal, type:
```
pip3 install tk
```
